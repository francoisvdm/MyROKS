## My ROKS
1. Use [IBM Techzone](https://techzone.ibm.com/) to install OpenShift. Use "Cloud Pak for Integration Activation Kit".  When available, follow instructions on [DemoHub](https://ibm-garage-tsa.github.io/cp4i-demohub/overview/) to install Cloud Pak for Integration.

### License Service
By default license serivice is not activated. For instructions, see [Deploying License Service](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-integration/2021.2?topic=service-deploying-license-cloud-pak-integration)

### HowTo
From OpenShift console > Installed Operators, find the "IBM Cloud Pak for Integration Platform Navgator". Go to "Platform Navigator" tab, and open the yaml. Add the following two lines in the "spec" section:
------
`spec

  requestIbmServices:
   licensing: true`
------
Then save it. I've found that if I take too long to update and save, that a newer version of the yaml must be loaded, so I guess something is updating it in the background. So, make the update fast and save it.  Before I saved it, it looks like:
